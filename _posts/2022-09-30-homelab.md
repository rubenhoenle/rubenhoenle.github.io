# Raspberry Pi Setup
At first you should setup your Raspberry Pi by flashing a OS to your SD card. 
I recommend you to use the Raspberry Pi Imager for this. 
I'm using a Raspberry Pi 4 so I installed the 64 Bit version of Raspbian Lite (we don't need a Desktop because we want to run our Raspberry Pi headless). 
Remember to enable the SSH access inside the Raspberry Pi Imager. 
To make everything secure I strongly recommend you to use the SSH authentication via publickey, which you can also enable easily in the Raspberry Pi Imager tool.  

After plugging in your network cable and booting up your Raspberry Pi install docker and docker compose.

## Assign your Raspberry Pi a static IP address
For this project we need our Raspberry Pi to always have the same IP address.

## What Pihole is and why we need it
Pihole is a network-wide Adblocker.

## What is Traefik and why do we need it?
Reverse Proxy, handles HTTPS certificates
